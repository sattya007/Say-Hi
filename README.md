# Say-Hi
"SAY HI" is a client-server based web chat application built using JavaScript's socket.io, express, and JSON. The application is divided into two main components: the frontend folder for the client-side and the backend folder for the server-side.

The frontend of "SAY HI" provides a user-friendly interface for users to engage in real-time conversations. It leverages socket.io events to establish a seamless communication channel between the client and server. Users can easily send and receive messages, view the chat history, and stay updated with the latest conversations.

On the server-side, the backend folder contains the necessary logic to handle incoming requests and manage the chat functionality. Express, a popular web application framework, is utilized to create a robust and scalable server. It allows for efficient routing and handling of HTTP requests, ensuring a smooth chat experience for users.

To exchange data between the client and server, "SAY HI" uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON provides a lightweight and human-readable format for transmitting data, making it an ideal choice for a chat application. Messages are serialized into JSON objects before being transmitted and deserialized upon reception, ensuring compatibility and easy parsing of data between the client and server.

Overall, "SAY HI" is a feature-rich chat application that offers a user-friendly interface, real-time communication capabilities, and efficient data transmission using socket.io, express, and JSON.
